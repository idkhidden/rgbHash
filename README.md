# rgbHash
rgbHash is a algorithm that utilizes RGB data from screenshots to generate a unique key and transform input text into a non-reversible hash. This approach provides a non-cryptographic method for custom data transformation tasks and non-security-related use cases, inspiration from Cloudflare's innovative encryption techniques.


## Features
- Capture screenshots to extract RGB data.
- Generate unique, non-reversible hashes based on screenshot RGB data.


## Note
Please note that it is intended for educational and experimental purposes only. It does not provide cryptographic security and should not be used for real-world applications requiring secure data hashing.


## License
rgbHash is licensed under the MIT License. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for more details.
